      <p>
        I am 28 years old woman from Nord-Hordaland. I have a master in
        Archaeology from the University in Bergen. In spring 2019 I participated
        in a digital learning project with erasmus+ in Denmark. I enjoy learning
        new things, and have studied in both the UK and in Rome. Currently I am
        an entrant at Kodehode, where I'm learning html, css, javascript and
        react.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am bit of a nerd, so in my free time I enjoy playing Dungeons&Dragons,
        boardgames and magic the gathering. I also enjoy playing videogames such
        as Zelda: breath of the wild, Witcher 3 and Overwatch.
